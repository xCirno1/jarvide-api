# jarvide-api
The API for interacting with user files

This API is not meant for public use (as of now). We may expose public endpoints later on. For now, while the endpoints are technically public,
you will need the authorization key to access any endpoints.

# Technologies
As of right now, the only technologies in use are:
  - Node.js
  - Prisma
  - Express.js
  - SQLite (Planning on transitioning to PostgreSQL)

# General Reference <a name="ref"></a>
### File Object <a name="file-obj"></a>
A `File` object contains the following properties:
- `fileID: String` - The unique indentifier associated with this file.
- `filename: String` - The name of this file.
- `url: String` - The Discord attachment URL that points to this file.

Example `File` object:
```json
{
  "fileID": "ab0915fa-271b-480b-a606-2ba9d3c2613d",
  "filename": "index.js",
  "url": "https://www.discord.com/attachments/123456789/123456789"
}
```

### Errors <a name="errors"></a>
All **4XX** error codes will always return a JSON alongside their error codes.
This is the syntax for one:
```json
{
  "ERROR": "MESSAGE"
}
```
Where `MESSAGE` is a short but descriptive string 
that gives more information on what exactly went wrong.
The response code will also closely reflect the error.

### Authentication <a name="auth"></a>
Since the API is currently in an invite-only private stage, you will need an API key to access **any** endpoint. I have given out the API key to a select few. Following is intructions on how to use it.

When sending **any** request to **any** endpoint, you **will** need the API key in the **header**. This is important because it will not be accepted anywhere else (URL params, POST request body, etc...) Here is an example on how one might successfully send an authenticated request to the server:

```
GET https://server-ip/get_file?fileID=579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6

HEADERS 
{
  "Api-Key": "YOUR API KEY HERE"
}
```

# Examples <a name="examples"></a>
Following are a few examples on how to use the different endpoints.
The actual IP of the API server or the domain should be substituted for `server-ip`.

Please also keep in mind the authentication has been left out these examples for the sake of brevity and that they are all identical. If you want to know how to authenticate correctly, please refer to the [Authentication](#auth) section

```
POST https://server-ip/file/

{
  "userID": "432643355634171905",
  "filename": "index.js",
  "url": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844432226745057280/929190129397022750/index.js"
}
```

```
GET https://server-ip/file?fileID=579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6
```
Note that for most libraries that aid in making HTTP requests, there will
most likely be a way to pass in a JSON-like object for the querystring params
rather than having to format it manually.

```
DELETE https://server-ip/file?fileID=579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6
```

```
PATCH https://server-ip/file

{
  "fileID": "579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6",
  "filename": "new_index.js",
  "url": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844432226745057280/929190129397022750/new_index.js"
